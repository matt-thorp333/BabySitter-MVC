OhioHealth Babysitter Kata submission by Matt Thorp

This project was developed in Visual Studio 2017 using C#, MVC 5.

Upon opening the solution you can simply run it to interact with the web application in your browser.

For testing, from the top menu select Test -> Run -> All Tests.

Although such situations are dealt with server-side, with more time I would add 
client-side validation (i.e. start time must be before end time etc.) before form submission.
